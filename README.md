# Academic Website

My personal academic website built with HTML, CSS, and Markdown.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Main page
- `content/`: Markdown files for each page
- `styles.css`: Website styles
- Images and other assets

## Local Development
1. Clone the repository
2. Run a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server 8000`)
3. Open `localhost:8000` in your browser

## Updates
Edit the markdown files in the `content` directory to update the website content.

## Hobbies

I am an otaku (お宅), a Japanese word means that I prefer to stay at home and watch animes, movies, play games and enjoy my own world. I love Janpanese animes and in order to understand what they are talking about and learn more about their culture, I study Japanese by myself using textbooks and online tutorials. Currently, I reach N2 level, and can read and understand most of the conversations in animes.

I love anime with delicate character designs and good stories:

* [**Violet Evergarden (ヴァイオレット・エヴァーガーデン)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violet_Evergarden): This anime is a story about a girl used to be a killing tool in war, pursues the meaning of life and love.

For movies, I particularly like sci-fi movies, and animes.

* [**Interstellar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstellar_(film)): I love the story and have seen it many times. I am amazed by the imagination of the higher dimensional space in Gargantua, a big black hole.

* [**Your Name (君の名は)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Name): This tells a story about a boy and girl who swap bodies, and saving a small town from the infall of a comet. This story is very touching and animation is amazing that every scence looks like a piece of art.

Except for animes, movies and games. I derive great pleasure to study programming. I learned basics of C++ by myself using "C++ Primer" and "C++ Primer Plus" in order to enhance my programming skills in Python, since on some aspects, they are very similar. 
Additionally, I am particularly interested in AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, and so on. Even this website is generated from scratch totally based on [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), an AI based code editor, without any prior knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Furthermore, I am actively learning GUI programming using [PyQt](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/), [Pyside](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python), and other packages from the AI tools.
